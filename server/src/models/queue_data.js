// not sure if this file is required?
// it's not downloaded on save-and-download, but queue_data field is still there in postgresql
// otherwise some of the queue points show up in map_json but not all of them?

// sample queue_data from postgresql db:
// [[["012.017", 0], ["011.017", 1], ["011.016", 1], ["011.015", 1], ["011.014", 4]]]
